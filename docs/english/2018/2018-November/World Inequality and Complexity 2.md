### Part 1 翻译

#### Should our best minds be `dedicated` to solving our biggest problems?

#### Should Harvard encourage its `faculty` to take on the world's `worst` inequities? Should Harvard students learn about the `depth` of global `poverty`, the `prevalence` of world hunger, the `scarcity` of clean water, the girls kept out of school, the children who die from diseases we can cure?

#### Should the world's most `privileged` people learn about the lives of the world's least privileged?

#### These are not `rhetorical` questions - you will answer with your `policies`.
我们最顶尖的智慧是否在解决我们最大的问题？

哈佛是否鼓励全体教员致力于解决世界上最差的不平等？哈佛的学生是否了解全球性的贫穷，世界上普遍的饥荒，水资源的匮乏，不能上学的女孩们、还有那些能够被治疗却死于疾病的儿童。

那些世界上最有权利的人是否了解在底层的人的生活？

这些问题并不夸张，你们可以根据你们的见解回答。

### Part 2 翻译

#### My mother who was filled with pride the day I was admitted here - never stopped pressing me to do more for others. A few days before my wedding, she `hosted` a `bridal` event, at which she read aloud a letter about marriage that she had written to Melinda. My mother was very ill with cancer at the time, but she saw one more opportunity to deliver her message, and at the close of the letter she said, "From those to whom much is given, much is `expected`."

#### When you consider what those of us here in this yard have been given - in talent, privilege, and opportunity - there is almost no limit to what the world has a right to expect from us.

#### In line with the promise of this age, I want to `exhort` each of the graduates here to take on an issue - a complex problem, a deep inequity, and become a `specialist` on it. If you make it the focus of your `career`, that would be `phenomenal`. But you don't have to do that to make an `impact`. For a few hours every week, you can use the growing power of the internet to get informed, find others with the same interests, see the `barriers`, and find ways to cut through them.

我被哈佛录取的时候，我的母亲对此充满自豪，她从未停止过督促我为别人做更多的事。在我结婚的时候，她主持了婚礼，大声的读了一封她写给Melinda的一封关于婚姻的信。那时候我的母亲患了癌症，病的很重，但她不放过每一个能过传达她信息的人，在信的末尾她说道，给予的越多，期望就越大。

你考虑下我们在这个花园的人被给予了什么，天赋、特权、机会，这个世界对我们的期望是无限的。

同这个时代的期望一样，我要劝告没一个毕业生去解决一个复杂的问题，不平等的问题，并把自己变成这方面的专家。如果你把它当做毕生的事业，那将是非凡的。但你不需要那样做去产生影响。每周花几个小时的时间，你可以利用日益发展的互联网获取信息，找到志同道合的人，发现障碍，并解决它们。

### Part 3 翻译

#### Don't let complexity stop you. Be activists. Take on the big inequities. It will be one of the great experiences of your lives.

#### You graduates are coming of age in an amazing time. As you leave Harvard, you have technology that members of my class never had. You have awareness of global inequity, which we did not have. And with that awareness, you likely also have an informed `conscience` that will `torment` you if you `abandon` these people whose lives you could change with very little `effort`. You have more than we had; you must start sooner, and carry on longer.

#### Knowing what you know, how could you not?

#### And I hope you will come back here to Harvard 30 years from now and reflect on that you have done with your talent and your energy. I hope you will judge yourselves not on your professional accomplishments alone, but also on how well you have addressed the world's deepest inequities, on how well you treated people a world away who have nothing in common with you but their humanity.

不要让复杂阻止你，做个积极分子。直面巨大的不公，这将会是你生命中最棒的经历。

你们毕业的时期正处于一个令人惊叹的时代。你们离开哈佛的时候，拥有这我们这代人从未有过的技术。你们已经认识到了世界的不平等，但我们那时候并没有。有了这些认识，当你抛弃那些你仅仅需要出一点力就能帮助的人的时候，你的良心会受到折磨。你们比我们拥有的更多，你们必须尽快开始，并且长久的保持着。

知道你所了解的，怎能不去做呢？

我希望你们30年后能够返回哈佛，回想一下你们用自己的天赋和努力所做的一切。我希望你们评价自己的时候，不要只看你们的专业方面的成就，而要看你们怎样好的解决这世界深深的不平等，怎样对待那些与你隔着千山万水，并且和你毫不相干的人们。

## 原文阅读

Should our best minds be dedicated to solving our biggest problems?

Should Harvard encourage its faculty to take on the world's worst inequities? Should Harvard students learn about the depth of global poverty, the prevalence of world hunger, the scarcity of clean water, the girls kept out of school, the children who die from diseases we can cure?

Should the world's most privileged people learn about the lives of the world's least privileged?

These are not rhetorical questions - you will answer with your policies.
