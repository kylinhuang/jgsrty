It is my temper and I like it the better, to affect all harmony: and sure there is music even in the beauty, and the silent note which Cupid strikes, far sweeter than the sound of an instrument. For there is a music where ever there is a harmony, order, or proportion: and thus far we may maintain the music of the sphears; for those well-ordered motions, and regular paces, though they give no sound unto the ear, yet to the understanding thet strike a note most full of harmony. Whatsoever is harmonically composed delights in harmony, which make me much distrust the symmetry of those heads which declaim against all Church-Music. For myself, not only for my obedience, but my particular Genius, I do embrace it: for even that vulgar and Tavern-Music, which makes one man merry, another mad, strikes in me a deep ft of devotion, and a profound contemplation of the First Com-poser. There is something in it of divinity more then the car discovers: it is an hieroglyphical and shadowed lesson of the whole world, and creatures of GOD; such a melody to the ear, as the whole world, well understood, would afford the understanding. In brief, it is a sensible fit of that harmony which intellectually sounds in the ears of GOD.
