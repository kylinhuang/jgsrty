### Part 1 翻译

#### Set yourself free from anything that might hinder you in becoming the person you want to be. Free yourself from the uncertainties about your `abilities` or the worth of your dreams, from the `fears` that you may not be able to achieve them or that they won't be what you wanted.

#### Set yourself free from the past. The good things from yesterday are still yours in memory, the things you want to forget you will, for tomorrow is only a sunrise away. Free yourself from regret or `guilt`, and promise to live this day as fully as you can.

#### Set yourself free from the expectations of others, and never feel guilty or `embarrassed` if you do not live up to their `standards`. You are most important to yourself, live by what you feel if best and right for you. Others will come to respect your `integrity` and honesty.

#### Set yourself free to simply be yourself, and you will `soar` higher than you've ever dreamed.
让自己从任何阻碍你成为你想要成为的人的事情中挣脱出来。让自己从对自己能力和梦想的价值不确定中挣脱出来，让自己从不能实现它们或者不是你想要的恐惧中解脱出来。

让自己从过去中解脱出来。昨天美好的事情依旧会在你的记忆之中，你想忘记的事你就会忘记，对于明天来说又是新的一天。让自己从悔恨和内疚中解脱出来，并承诺会充实的过好今天。

让自己从别人的期待中解脱出来，不要因为没有达到别人制定的标准而感到内疚和尴尬。对你来说自己最重要，活出你感觉最好、最适合自己的生活。别人会尊重你的正直和诚实。

做简单的自己，你将会飞的比你梦想的还要更高。
